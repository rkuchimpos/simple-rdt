  Workload
------------

We divided the workload between the client and server code for the most part. Jesse worked on the 
server code while Ricardo worked on the client code. We worked together to write a packet class and
to access a packet's header and payload. Ricardo also implemented a utility class for helper 
functions.

In testing our code, we helped each other find bugs in each others' code and made small adjustments
to our opposite source codes.

We worked on the report together.
